## ElectoralDatabase

*ElectoralDatabase is a Java-based application designed to manage and store information about candidates appearing in elections. The application connects to a MySQL database and performs basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on candidate data using Hibernate Framework.*

## Project Overview
The project contains the following components:

Entity Class: Defines the structure of the candidate data (such as name, party, age, gender, etc.) which is mapped to a table in the MySQL database.

DAO Layer: The Data Access Object (DAO) layer interacts with the MySQL database. It provides methods to execute CRUD operations, such as adding a new candidate, retrieving candidate information, updating candidate details, and deleting candidates from the database.

Database Connection: The project establishes a connection to the MySQL database using JDBC. It performs operations like inserting new records and querying the database.

## Database Table Contents
<b>SrNo:-</b> <p>it contains candidate id</p>
<b>name:-</b><p> it contains name of the candidate</p>
<b>partyname:-</b><p> it contains partyname of the candidate</p>
<b>assembly:- </b><p>It contains assembly of the candidate</p>
<b>gender:-</b><p> it contains the gender of the candidate </p>
<b>age:-</b><p> it contains the age of the candidate </p>

*Features
CRUD Operations:<br>

<p>Create: Insert new candidate information into the database.</p><br>
<p>Read: Retrieve candidate information based on various filters (name, age, party).</p><br>
<p>Update: Update existing candidate data (e.g., change age, name, or party affiliation).</p><br>
<p>Delete: Remove candidates from the database. </p><br>
<p> <b>MySQL Database Connection: Connects to a MySQL database, ensuring smooth interaction and persistent storage of candidate data.</b></p><br>



## Future Enhancements<br>
Implement transaction management for handling multiple operations (insert/update/delete) in one transaction.<br>
Implement input validation and error handling to ensure better user interaction.<br>
Add a user interface (UI) for easier candidate management.<br>
Include unit tests to ensure CRUD operations work as expected.<br>
